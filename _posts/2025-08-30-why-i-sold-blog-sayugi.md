description: Reflections on why I had to let go of Blog Sayugi.
---

Writing this is not easy. Blog Sayugi was never just a blog to me—it was part of my personal journey. A place where I wrote, learned, and grew. But in 2023, I made a difficult decision: I sold the blog.

Many people asked, “Why did you sell it?”  
The answer is simple, but not easy: I was at my lowest point, and I needed to survive.

## When Reality Doesn’t Match Expectations

At the time, I was trying to build a small business. I wanted to explore something beyond blogging—to take a chance in the business world. But things didn’t go as planned.

The business failed. I lost many things, including financial stability. In the middle of that chaos, I had to make a hard choice: to sell something I had built with heart.

## A Difficult Decision: Selling Blog Sayugi

Blog Sayugi was one of the most valuable things I had at the time. But I had to let it go. I sold it because I needed funds to fulfill responsibilities and restart my life.

Since then, I’ve had no involvement in managing the blog. Although many of the articles there are still my work, I have no idea how the blog is run today.

And this is important for me to say:  
I am not responsible for any content, activity, or transaction made in my name—Gylang Satria Yudha—on blogsayugi.com.  
If someone contacts you or claims to be me through that blog, please be cautious.

## Writing Again, Returning to My Roots

Now I’m back to writing on this personal blog. Simple, ad-free, and pressure-free. A place where I can write honestly, without chasing numbers or targets.

I don’t know how far this blog will go. But I do know one thing: I want to write from the heart again.

Thank you to those who once read my work on Blog Sayugi. And to those who just found me here—welcome.  
This is not the end, it’s just a new chapter.
