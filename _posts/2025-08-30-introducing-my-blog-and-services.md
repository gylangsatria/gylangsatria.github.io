Welcome to my personal site — a curated space where I document what works, what breaks, and what I learn along the way.

I’m **Gylang Satria Yudha**, a technical writer, systems troubleshooter, and Chrome extension tinkerer based in West Java, Indonesia. This site serves as a lightweight companion to my main blog and technical services.

## [blog.gylang.my.id](https://blog.gylang.my.id) – Field Notes & Technical Experiments

This is where I publish in-depth documentation and real-world troubleshooting logs. Topics range from Linux server recovery and SLiMS module audits to Chrome extension workflows and UI refinement.

A few recent posts:

- *Fixing Timeshift-gtk Not Launching on Linux*
- *Deploying SLiMS9 Bulian on Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS*
- *Restoring a Hacked School Website*

The blog also offers free member access to exclusive content and templates.

## Services & Projects

I specialize in building maintainable, user-driven solutions with clear documentation. My current focus areas include:

- **Blocklist Automation**: Converting raw text filters into validated Chrome JSON rules with deduplication.
- **UI Feedback & Documentation**: Designing actionable, professional feedback systems for technical and non-technical users.
- **SLiMS Debugging**: Auditing PHP modules and SQL queries for library systems.
- **Technical Writing**: Producing SOPs, guides, and articles with precise terminology and immediate usability.

I believe good documentation is not an afterthought — it’s the backbone of sustainable solutions.  
If you're curious, feel free to explore, contribute feedback, or reach out for collaboration.

This site ([gylangsatria.github.io](https://gylangsatria.github.io)) will continue to host lighter updates, quick notes, and personal reflections alongside the main blog.
